## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository tracks my progress through the official Rustlings
 course.
Itâ€™s a live record of learning Rust step-by-step before moving into Solana and Anchor smart contract development.

# ðŸ¦€ Rustlings Exercises

A collection of small exercises to get hands-on practice with the Rust programming language.
Each folder contains focused challenges covering different Rust fundamentals â€” from variables and ownership to lifetimes, traits, and concurrency.
